With CNN and Tensorflow, I created a age and gender prediction model. First run the training model (agepredict5), then the test model (agepredict5test). Or install the h5 model (readily trained) and run the test model.

This uses the UTKFace dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new
A dataset with over 20,000 images of faces from different ages, races and genders.
